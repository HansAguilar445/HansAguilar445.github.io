It was a thrust like lightning.
A spearhead thrust to pierce my heart.
Trying to dodge it would be useless.
Being lightning, it's invisible to the human eye.
But...
The lightning that tries to pierce me...
...Is repelled by the moonlight that tries to save me.
Clang, a beautiful sound.
No, the sound before me is heavier than steel.
The armor she is wearing is not beautiful at all and as unrefined as the
cold night.
The sound wasn't beautiful at all.
It was actually the sound of steel.
It's just that the knight is beautiful enough to turn it into a charming
sound like a bell.
"―――I ask of you. Are you my Master?"
She asks in a voice that lights up the darkness.
