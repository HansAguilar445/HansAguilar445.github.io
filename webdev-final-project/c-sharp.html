                        <!-- Introduction to C# -->
                        <p>
                            C# is an object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft using their .NET framework. 
                            It is very similar to the Java programming language, having been initially designed as such to conform 
                            to ECMA’s standards. Applications that are programmed in C# include: 
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>Games built in the Unity Engine</p></li>
                            <li><p>The Nintendo Switch emulator called Ryujinx</p></li>
                            <li><p>Paint.NET</p></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            C# was first released in 2002 with the .NET Framework’s 1.0 release. Its most recent version is 
                            C# 10.0, released in November of 2021 alongside .NET 6.0.

                    <h3>Setting up</h3>
                    <div id="setting-up">
                        <!-- Conditions to continue -->
                        <p>
                            Before you start programming, please ensure the following conditions have been fulfilled: 
                        </p>
                        <!-- Important tag list -->
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Your IDE must be compatible with .cs files
                                    
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    .NET must be installed and up to date
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Once these conditions have been fulfilled, you can start by creating a file. For the purpose of 
                            this guide, you should use Visual Studio as the IDE as it does not require much setup. The file 
                            type for C# code is .cs, though Visual Studio also adds .sln files to contain the project.
                        </p>

                    <h3>Basic rules of programming</h3>
                    <div id="rule">
                        <p>
                            Now that you have a file to write a program in, there are specific conventions that you must remember 
                            when writing code in C#. These are shared with most other programming languages, so keep the following 
                            rules in mind when following this beginner’s guide:
                        </p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="assets/img/classic-blunder.png">
                            <figcaption>Figure 1: What happens when you forget a semicolon.</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Always end lines of code with semicolons (<code>;</code>). This tells the computer to go to the next line when 
                                    you run the code, so forgetting one can cause errors and break the program.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Remember that code is case-sensitive. Not capitalizing one method that you want to use when it needs a capital 
                                    letter is another mistake that causes errors and breaks the program.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Name your variables something that makes sense for what they do. It helps you figure out what purpose every variable 
                                    fulfills if something goes wrong after running the program.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Indent your code. Code that is misaligned is hard to read.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Put comments in your code. This helps you define what role each chunk of code serves in the overall program. 
                                    Use <code>//</code> for comments that use one line or <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code> to define where a 
                                    multi-line comment starts and ends.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Console outputs</h3>
                    <div id="console-outputs">
                        <p>
                            To start out simply, you will write some sentences in the terminal. It is the traditional starting point for any beginner 
                            in a programming language, the classic "Hello World" message. The template for a console application always starts with 
                            the message, but you might not understand how it all works. To explain, the message is sent to the terminal using the method called 
                            <code>WriteLine()</code>, which is a method connected to the Console object 
                            (<code>Console.</code>). You put data in the brackets, like Boolean (true or false) statements, equations, and strings of text, and 
                            it outputs the results. Some examples include:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    <code>Console.WriteLine("Hello World");</code>, which results in the words "Hello World" (quotation marks not included) being outputted from the console.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    <code>Console.WriteLine(1 > 0);</code>, which results in a value of True being outputted to the console.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    <code>Console.WriteLine(2 * 6);</code>, which results in a value of 12 being outputted to the console.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <figure>

                        <p>
                            With this in mind, experiment to see what results you get from the terminal as practice. The code from before
                            will work, so copy it and adjust the values to see what happens. Once you feel ready, continue to the next part.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Variables</h3>
                    <div id="variables">
                        <p>
                            The natural next step after finding out how to output information to the terminal is to define variables in the code. 
                            As the name implies, these are placeholders that you define to substitute for actual data. There are seven main data 
                            types that variables can be defined as, which the following table will detail:
                        </p>
                        <div class="table">

                            In order to use variables, you need to declare them using the data type’s name and define 
                            them with a value. These are formatted as <code>datatype variableName = value;</code>. From there, you 
                            can use them as you need by using the name to stand in for the value in the code you are writing. 
                        </p>
                        <h4>Changing declared variables</h4>
                        <div id="decladed">
                            <p>
                                Another important concept to keep in mind with variables is that you can change them later in the program. 
                                This is used in several ways, like iterating through loops and accepting user input. You can change the 
                                value of your variables by: 
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><p>Defining a new value. Example: <code>x = 5;</code></p></li>
                                <li><p>Using specific operators. Examples: <code>x++;</code>, <code>x--;</code>, <code>x *= 3;</code></p></li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Be careful not to change the variables in ways that they cannot accept, such as adding a <code>string</code> to an int, as that can cause errors.

                        <h4>User input</h4>
                        <div id="user">
                            <p>
                                Now that you know how to use variables in your code, one more option opens up in the terminal: user input. Using another <code>Console</code> method
                                called <code>ReadLine()</code>, you can use a <code>string</code> to record what the user wrote in the previous line of the terminal. The following 
                                code block demonstrates <code>ReadLine()</code> in use to record a message:
                            </p>
                            <div class="code">
                                <code>
                                    <p>string message = Console.ReadLine();</p>
                                    <p>Console.WriteLine(message);</p>
                                </code>
                            </div>
                            <p>
                                <code>ReadLine()</code> returns a string value, so if you want to use numerical values, you will need to convert the string to the data type you want
                                the appropriate data type for the job.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Conditional Statements</h3>
                    <div id="conditional">
                        <p>
                            With variables explained, conditional statements are next for important concepts. These allow you to control what actions the 
                            computer takes when specific conditions are fulfilled, like when a variable exceeds a certain size. There are two main types 
                            of conditional statements, the "if-else" type and the "switch-case" type.
                        </p>
                        <h4>If-else statements</h4>
                        <div id="if">
                            <p>
                                The "if-else" statement type is the most common type of conditional statement that you use. You use these when you want to set 
                                one or more conditions for code to trigger, especially if you have multiple variables you want to use. Take the following steps to use one:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><p>Write <code>if</code> and put a set of round brackets next to it. It should look like this: <code>if ()</code></p></li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        In the round brackets, write the conditions you want for the code to execute. Examples: <code>x == 1</code>, 
                                        <code>x &gt; 0</code>, <code>x &lt; 2</code>, <code>x == true</code> (do not use this as it is redundant)
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>
                                                You can also set more than one if you need to using OR (<code>||</code>) or AND (<code>&amp;&amp;</code>) between conditions.
                                                Example: <code>(x &gt; str.Length && !active)</code>
                                            </p>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        After the round brackets, add a set of curly braces. They can be right next to the start of the statement or on the next line. 
                                        Example: <code>if (x &gt; 0) {}</code>
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        In between the curly braces, write the code you want to trigger when the if statement is fulfilled.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>
                                In the end, it should look like this: 
                            </p>
                            <div class="code">
                                <code>
                                    <p>if (condition)</p>
                                    <p>{</p>
                                    <p>//Put your code here</p>
                                    <p>}</p>
                                </code>
                            </div>
                            <p>
                                You can also follow up by using <code>else if (condition)</code> and/or <code>else</code> to trigger when your first set of 
                                conditions are not met and another set is met. The following code block demonstrates this:
                            </p>
                            <div class="code">
                                <code>
                                    <p>//The second option is picked</p>
                                    <p>int x = 10;</p>
                                    <p>if (x &lt; 10)</p>
                                    <p>{</p>
                                    <p class="indent-1">Console.WriteLine("x is less than 10.");</p>
                                    <p>} else if (x == 10)</p>
                                    <p>{</p>
                                    <p class="indent-1">Console.WriteLine("x is 10.");</p>
                                    <p>} else</p>
                                    <p>{</p>
                                    <p class="indent-1">Console.WriteLine("x is greater than 10.");</p>
                                    <p>}</p>
                                </code>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                            <p>
                                The "switch-case" statement type is the other main type of conditional statement that you can use in your code. It gives you an easier time 
                                with setting up multiple conditions in certain situations and it is easier to read. You would use these when you want to open up more 
                                options for your program when one specific variable is the deciding factor for its path.

                                To create a "switch-case" statement like the one above, follow these steps:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        Write <code>switch()</code> and put the name of the controlling variable in the brackets. Example: <code>switch(str)</code>
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li><p>Put a set of curly braces next to or underneath the start of the statement.</p></li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        In between the curly braces, write the options. They should be formatted as <code>case value:</code>. Example,:
                                        <code>case "monday":</code>, <code>case "friday":</code>
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>
                                                You can also set a default option. To set a default option, place <code>default:</code> at the end of your statement.
                                            </p>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        After each option, write the code that you want to execute underneath each <code>case</code>.
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                        At the end of the code you want to execute for each case, add <code>break;</code>. This will exit the statement once the code
                                        under each case has run.
                                    </p>

                                Keep in mind that unless you want to put "if-else" statements inside the cases, only one variable can be set at a time to control the statement. 
                                This is not the case with "if-else" statements, where you can set several conditions using multiple variables. Use these when you only have 
                                one main variable to control how the code functions.

                    <h3>Loops</h3>
                    <div id="loops">
                        <p>
                            Now that conditional statements are out of the way, the final main concept a C# programmer will need to remember is the concept of looping 
                            code. Loops allow you to reduce the number of lines you need to write by repeating specific lines that you place inside a loop. There are 
                            three main kinds of loops that you normally use in C#.
                        </p>
                        <h4>While loops</h4>
                        <div id="while">
                            <p>
                                The first and easiest to understand type of loop is the "while" type of loop. The syntax is similar to an "if-else" statement, with the only 
                                difference being that while replaces if. Code within a while loop repeats as long as the conditions you put in the brackets are being 
                                fulfilled. However, if the conditions are never met, the loop never runs. The following example code demonstrates a while loop being used 
                                to count every time a number is even:
                            </p>
                            <div class="code">
                                <code>
                                    <p>//Counts the number of even numbers in the loop</p>
                                    <p>int loop = 0;</p>
                                    <p>int even = 0;</p>
                                    <p>while (loop &lt; 7)</p>
                                    <p>{</p>
                                    <p class="indent-1">loop++;</p>
                                    <p class="indent-1">Console.WriteLine("Loop number " + loop);</p>
                                    <p class="indent-1">if (loop % 2 == 0)</p>
                                    <p class="indent-1">{</p>
                                    <p class="indent-2">evens++;</p>
                                    <p class="indent-1">}</p>
                                    <p class="indent-1">Console.WriteLine("Even numbers: " + evens);</p>
                                    <p>}</p>
                                </code>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <h4>Do-while loops</h4>
                        <div id="do-while">
                            <p>
                                A "do-while" loop is similar to a "while" loop in that it performs the same function, but the way you use it is different. The syntax of a 
                                "do-while" loop puts the looping condition at the end of the code. This means that the loop will trigger at least once, even if the looping 
                                conditions are never met. The following example code uses a "do-while" loop to ask for a password:
                            </p>
                            <div class="code">
                                <code>
                                    <p>string pass = "";</p>
                                    <p>do</p>
                                    <p>{</p>
                                    <p class="indent-1">Console.WriteLine("Please enter your password.");</p>
                                    <p class="indent-1">pass = Console.ReadLine();</p>
                                    <p class="indent-1">if (pass == "password123")</p>
                                    <p class="indent-1">{</p>
                                    <p class="indent-2">Console.WriteLine("Password is valid. Exiting program.");</p>
                                    <p class="indent-1">} else</p>
                                    <p class="indent-1">{</p>
                                    <p class="indent-2">Console.WriteLine("Invalid password.");</p>
                                    <p class="indent-1">}</p>
                                    <p>} while(pass != "password123");</p>
                                </code>
                            </div>
                            <p>Unlike other loops, this one requires a semicolon at its end.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h4>For loops</h4>
                        <div id="for">
                            <p>
                                The third and most important type of loop is the "for" type of loop. "For" loops differ from the other two kinds of loops because unlike the 
                                others, you can set the number of times it loops without creating a variable beforehand. You do this by setting a local variable inside the 
                                loop, usually an <code>int</code> named <code>i</code> (for iteration), and setting the condition to something you want it to avoid reaching 
                                until a certain time. The local variable can be used inside the loop for things like adding to another variable or cycling through an array, 
                                but cannot be used outside the loop unless you declare it again outside of the loop. The following example code outputs the value of <code>i</code>> 
                                into the console 10 times:
                            </p>
                            <div class="code">
                                <code>
                                    <p>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)</p>
                                    <p>{</p>
                                    <p class="indent-1">Console.WriteLine(i);</p>
                                    <p>}</p>
                                </code>
                            </div>
                        </div>
