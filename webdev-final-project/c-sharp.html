                        <!-- Introduction to C# -->
                        <p>
                            <b>C#</b> is an object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft using their .NET framework. 
                            It is very similar to the Java programming language, having been initially designed as such to conform 
                            to ECMA’s standards. Applications that are programmed in C# include: 
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>Games built in the Unity Engine</p></li>
                            <li><p>The Nintendo Switch emulator called Ryujinx</p></li>
                            <li><p>Paint.NET</p></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            C# was first released in 2002 with the .NET Framework’s 1.0 release. Its most recent version is 
                            C# 10.0, released in November of 2021 alongside .NET 6.0.

                    <h3>Setting up</h3>
                    <div id="setting-up">
                        <!-- Conditions to continue -->
                        <p>
                            Before you start programming, please ensure the following conditions have been fulfilled: 
                        </p>
                        <!-- Important tag list -->
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Your IDE must be compatible with .cs files
                                    
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    .NET must be installed and up to date
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Once these conditions have been fulfilled, you can start by creating a file. For the purpose of 
                            this guide, you should use Visual Studio as the IDE as it does not require much setup. The file 
                            type for C# code is .cs, though Visual Studio also adds .sln files to contain the project.
                        </p>

                    <h3>Basic rules of programming</h3>
                    <div id="rules">
                        <p>
                            Now that you have a file to write a program in, there are specific conventions that you must remember 
                            when writing code in C#. These are shared with most other programming languages, so keep the following 
                            rules in mind when following this beginner’s guide:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Always end lines of code with <b>semicolons</b> (<code>;</code>). This tells the computer to go to the next line when 
                                    you run the code, so forgetting one can cause errors and break the program.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Remember that code is <b>case-sensitive</b>. Not capitalizing one method that you want to use when it needs a capital 
                                    letter is another mistake that causes errors and breaks the program.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Name your <b>variables</b> something that makes sense for what they do. It helps you figure out what purpose every variable 
                                    fulfills if something goes wrong after running the program.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Indent your code. Code that is misaligned is hard to read.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Put comments in your code. This helps you define what role each chunk of code serves in the overall program. 
                                    Use <code>//</code> for comments that use one line or <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code> to define where a 
                                    multi-line comment starts and ends.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Console outputs</h3>
                    <div id="console-outputs">
                        <p>
                            To start out simply, you will write some sentences in the <b>terminal</b>. It is the traditional starting point for any beginner 
                            in a programming language, the classic "Hello World" message. The template for a console application always starts with 
                            the message, but you might not understand how it all works. To explain, the message is sent to the terminal using either 
                            the method called <code>WriteLine()</code> or a similar method called <code>Write()</code>, which are methods connected to the Console object 
                            (<code>Console.</code>). You put data in the brackets, like Boolean (true or false) statements, equations, and strings of text, and 
                            it outputs the results. Some examples include:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    <code>Console.WriteLine("Hello World");</code>, which results in the words "Hello World" (quotation marks not included) being outputted from the console.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    <code>Console.WriteLine(1 > 0);</code>, which results in a value of True being outputted to the console.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    <code>Console.WriteLine(2 * 6);</code>, which results in a value of 12 being outputted to the console.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            With this in mind, experiment to see what results you get from the terminal as practice. The code from before
                            will work, so copy it and adjust the values to see what happens. Once you feel ready, continue to the next part.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Variables</h3>
                    <div id="variables">
                        <p>
                            The natural next step after finding out how to output information to the terminal is to define variables in the code. 
                            As the name implies, these are placeholders that you define to substitute for actual data. There are seven main data 
                            types that variables can be defined as, which the following table will detail:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In order to use variables, you need to declare them using the data type’s name and define 
                            them with a value. These are formatted as <code>datatype variableName = value;</code>. From there, you 
                            can use them as you need by using the name to stand in for the value in the code you are writing. 
                        </p>
                        <h4>Changing declared variables</h4>
                        <div id="decladed">
                            <p>
                                Another important concept to keep in mind with variables is that you can change them later in the program. 
                                This is used in several ways, like iterating through loops and accepting user input. You can change the 
                                value of your variables by: 
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><p>Defining a new value. Example: <code>x = 5;</code></p></li>
                                <li><p>Using specific operators. Examples: <code>x++;</code>, <code>x--;</code>, <code>x *= 3;</code></p></li>
                                <li><p>Using type-specific methods to define a new value. Example: <code>str = str.Replace(oldString, newString);</code></p></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Be careful not to change the variables in ways that they cannot accept, such as adding a <code>string</code> to an int, as that can cause errors.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            With variables explained, conditional statements are next for important concepts. These allow you to control what actions the 
                            computer takes when specific conditions are fulfilled, like when a variable exceeds a certain size. There are two main types 
                            of conditional statements, the "if-else" type and the "switch-case" type.
                        </p>
                        <h4>If-else statements</h4>
                        <div id="if">
                            <p>
                                The "if-else" statement type is the most common type of conditional statement that you use. You use these when you want to set 
                                one or more conditions for code to trigger, especially if you have multiple variables you want to use. Take the following steps to use one:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><p>Write <code>if</code> and put a set of round brackets next to it. It should look like this: <code>if ()</code></p></li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        In the round brackets, write the conditions you want for the code to execute. Examples: <code>x == 1</code>, 
                                        <code>x &gt; 0</code>, <code>x &lt; 2</code>, <code>x == true</code> (do not use this as it is redundant)
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>
                                                You can also set more than one if you need to using OR (<code>||</code>) or AND (<code>&amp;&amp;</code>) between conditions.
                                                Example: <code>(x &gt; str.Length && !active)</code>
                                            </p>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        After the round brackets, add a set of curly braces. They can be right next to the start of the statement or on the next line. 
                                        Example: <code>if (x &gt; 0) {}</code>
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        In between the curly braces, write the code you want to trigger when the if statement is fulfilled.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>
                                In the end, it should look like this: 
                            </p>
                            <div class="code">
                                <code>
                                    <p>if (condition)</p>
                                    <p>{</p>
                                    <p>//Put your code here</p>
                                    <p>}</p>
                                </code>
                            </div>
                            <p>
                                You can also follow up by using <code>else if (condition)</code> and/or <code>else</code> to trigger when your first set of 
                                conditions are not met and another set is met. The following code block demonstrates this:
                            </p>
                            <div class="code">
                                <code>
                                    <p>//The second option is picked</p>
                                    <p>int x = 10;</p>
                                    <p>if (x &lt; 10)</p>
                                    <p>{</p>
                                    <p class="indent-1">Console.WriteLine("x is less than 10.");</p>
                                    <p>} else if (x == 10)</p>
                                    <p>{</p>
                                    <p class="indent-1">Console.WriteLine("x is 10.");</p>
                                    <p>} else</p>
                                    <p>{</p>
                                    <p class="indent-1">Console.WriteLine("x is greater than 10.");</p>
                                    <p>}</p>
                                </code>

                        </div>
                        <h4>Switch-case statements</h4>
                        <div id="switch">
                            <p>
                                The "switch-case" statement type is the other main type of conditional statement that you can use in your code. It gives you an easier time 
                                with setting up multiple conditions in certain situations and it is easier to read. You would use these when you want to open up more 
                                options for your program when one specific variable is the deciding factor for its path.

                                To create a "switch-case" statement like the one above, follow these steps:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        Write <code>switch()</code> and put the name of the controlling variable in the brackets. Example: <code>switch(str)</code>
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li><p>Put a set of curly braces next to or underneath the start of the statement.</p></li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        In between the curly braces, write the options. They should be formatted as <code>case value:</code>. Example,:
                                        <code>case "monday":</code>, <code>case "friday":</code>
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>
                                                You can also set a default option. To set a default option, place <code>default:</code> at the end of your statement.
                                            </p>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        After each option, write the code that you want to execute underneath each <code>case</code>.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        At the end of the code you want to execute for each case, add <code>break;</code>. This will exit the statement once the code
                                        under each case has run.
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                Keep in mind that unless you want to put "if-else" statements inside the cases, only one variable can be set at a time to control the statement. 
                                This is not the case with "if-else" statements, where you can set several conditions using multiple variables. Use these when you only have 
                                one main variable to control how the code functions.

                            Now that conditional statements are out of the way, the final main concept a C# programmer will need to remember is the concept of <b>looping 
                            code</b>. Loops allow you to reduce the number of lines you need to write by repeating specific lines that you place inside a loop. There are 
                            three main kinds of loops that you normally use in C#.
