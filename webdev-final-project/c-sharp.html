                        <!-- Introduction to C# -->
                        <p>
                            <b>C#</b> is an object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft using their .NET framework. 
                            It is very similar to the Java programming language, having been initially designed as such to conform 
                            to ECMA’s standards. Applications that are programmed in C# include: 
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>Games built in the Unity Engine</p></li>
                            <li><p>The Nintendo Switch emulator called Ryujinx</p></li>
                            <li><p>Paint.NET</p></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            C# was first released in 2002 with the .NET Framework’s 1.0 release. Its most recent version is 
                            C# 10.0, released in November of 2021 alongside .NET 6.0.

                    <h3>Setting up</h3>
                    <div id="setting-up">
                        <!-- Conditions to continue -->
                        <p>
                            Before you start programming, please ensure the following conditions have been fulfilled: 
                        </p>
                        <!-- Important tag list -->
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Your IDE must be compatible with .cs files
                                    
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    .NET must be installed and up to date
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Once these conditions have been fulfilled, you can start by creating a file. For the purpose of 
                            this guide, you should use Visual Studio as the IDE as it does not require much setup. The file 
                            type for C# code is .cs, though Visual Studio also adds .sln files to contain the project.
                        </p>

                    <h3>Basic rules of programming</h3>
                    <div id="attributes">
                        <p>
                            Now that you have a file to write a program in, there are specific conventions that you must remember 
                            when writing code in C#. These are shared with most other programming languages, so keep the following 
                            rules in mind when following this beginner’s guide:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Always end lines of code with semicolons (<span>;</span>). This tells the computer to go to the next line when 
                                    you run the code, so forgetting one can break the entire program.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Remember that code is case-sensitive. Not capitalizing one method that you want to use when it needs a capital 
                                    letter is another mistake that causes errors and breaks the program.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Name your variables something that makes sense for what they do. It helps you figure out what purpose every variable 
                                    fulfills if something goes wrong after running the program.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Indent your code. Code that is misaligned is hard to read.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Put comments in your code. This helps you define what role each chunk of code serves in the overall program. 
                                    Use <span>//</span> for comments that use one line or <span>/*</span> and <span>*/</span> to define where a 
                                    multi-line comment starts and ends.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Console outputs</h3>
                    <div id="console-outputs">
                        <p>
                            To start out simply, you will write some sentences in the terminal. It is the traditional starting point for any beginner 
                            in a programming language, the classic "Hello World" message. The template for a console application always starts with 
                            the message, but you might not understand how it all works. To explain, the message is sent to the terminal using either 
                            the method called <span>WriteLine()</span> or a similar method called <span>Write()</span>, which are methods connected to the Console object 
                            (<span>Console.</span>). You put data in the brackets, like Boolean (true or false) statements, equations, and strings of text, and 
                            it outputs the results. Some examples include:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    <span>Console.WriteLine("Hello World");</span> results in the words “Hello World” (quotation marks not included) being outputted from the console.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    <span>Console.WriteLine(1 > 0);</span> results in a value of True being outputted to the console.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    <span>Console.WriteLine(2 * 6);</span> results in a value of 12 being outputted to the console.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            With this in mind, experiment to see what results you get from the terminal as practice before moving on.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Variables</h3>
                    <div id="variables">
                        <p>
                            The natural next step after finding out how to output information to the terminal is to define variables in the code. 
                            As the name implies, these are placeholders that you define to substitute for actual data. There are seven main data 
                            types that variables can be defined as, which the following table will detail:
                        </p>
                        <div class="table">
                            <table>

                                    <td><p>6.02f</p></td>

                        <p>
                            In order to use variables, you need to declare them using the data type’s name and define 
                            them with a value. These are formatted as <span>datatype variableName = value;</span>. From there, you 
                            can use them as you need by using the name to stand in for the value in the code you are writing. 
                        </p>
                        <h4>Changing declared variables</h4>
                        <p>
                            Another important concept to keep in mind with variables is that you can change them later in the program. 
                            This is used in several ways, like iterating through loops and accepting user input. You can change the 
                            value of your variables by: 
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>Defining a new value. Example: <span>x = 5;</span></p></li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
