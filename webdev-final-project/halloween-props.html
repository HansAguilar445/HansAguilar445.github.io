                    <h2>Halloween Props</h2>
                    <div id="introduction">
                        <p>
							Halloween is an event that revolves around costumes. Props can be a key aspect of some costumes 
							and this guide is intended to help you make simple prop weapons to enhance your costume’s authenticity. 
							Be careful when following these steps because you could cut yourself if you are not.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Materials and equipment</h3>
                    <div id="materials">
                        <p>
							Before you start, view the following list of equipment and materials you will need to 
							make your prop:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>Cardboard (foam board is also a good substitute)</p></li>
                            <li><p>Paper</p></li>
                            <li><p>Masking tape</p></li>
							<li><p>A hot glue gun</p></li>
							<li><p>Hot glue sticks</p></li>
							<li><p>Clear tape (if you don't have a hot glue gun)</p></li>
							<li><p>Scissors</p></li>
							<li><p>A box cutter</p></li>
							<li><p>Colouring tools (paintbrushes and paint, colouring pencils, markers, etc.)</p></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
							It is recommended that you prepare some backup materials in case your prop weapon doesn’t 
							look like you want it to. Once you have finished gathering your materials and 
							equipment, you can start.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>References</h3>
                    <div id="references">
                        <p>
							First, you need references to help you ensure that it looks like what you want to make. 
							The following steps will help you prepare them.

							<li><p>Look for pictures of what you want to make.</p></li>
							<li>
								<p>
									On some paper, draw some templates of the original weapon and any detail pieces you might 
									want to attach.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									If there are patterns that you might find hard to recreate, use some paper to create 
									stencils. These stencils will make recreating the patterns you want easier.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									Cut the templates and stencils out and put them aside for use later.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							After you have all the reference material, you can move on to making the parts of your weapon.
						</p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Part Creation</h3>

                        <p>
							The next step of the prop-making process is making the actual components of the prop. There are 
							many ways of making them, but this method is the simplest one that is also sturdy. Follow these 
							steps to make the parts you need:

						</figure>
						<ol>
							<li>
								<p>
									Using the templates, outline the parts you need on the material you are going to make the 
									prop out of. It is recommended that you create several for each part to layer on top of each other
									for stability.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									Cut out the parts you drew on the material you chose. Be sure not to cut towards yourself 
									as that increases the risk of cutting yourself with whatever you're using.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									Layer any parts with multiple layers on top of each other and secure them together with glue or tape.
								</p>
							</li>

						<p>
							With all the pieces ready, you can begin the final assembly. The following list of steps will help you finish your prop.
						</p>
						
						<ol>
							<li><p>Place all of the parts in their proper places as seen in your design.</p></li>
							<li><p>Secure the parts with tape or glue.</p></li>
							
							<li>
								<p>
									Test the prop to check its strength. If it's flimsy, you might want to add some more of your construction material 
									to reinforce it.
								</p>
							</li>
							
							<li><p>Finish by decorating the prop.</p></li>
