                    <h3>What is SSL?</h3>

                        <p>
                            <b>Secure Socket Layer (SSL)</b> is an Internet protocol developed to ensure user privacy, authentication, and the integrity of any data 
                            transmitted in any communications across the internet. For this purpose, it uses asymmetric encryption, with the encryption keys 
                            bound to the site by an SSL certificate. Netscape created SSL in 1995, but <b>Transport Layer Security (TLS)</b> replaced it in 1999. 
                            Websites using either of these protocols have HTTPS in their URL.
                        </p>

                            <b>Encryption</b> is a method of hiding information from anyone besides the intended recipient. To do this, an algorithm scrambles the regular text 
                            in a way that requires a cryptographic <b>key</b> to unscramble. There are two kinds of encryption: <b>symmetric</b> and <b>asymmetric</b>. 
                            Symmetric uses a single key to encrypt and decrypt information. Asymmetric uses two separate keys for encrypting and decrypting. SSL and TLS use 
                            asymmetric encryption.

                        <p>
                            A website’s security relies on an <b>SSL certificate</b> to ensure that the protocol functions. An SSL certificate is a document binding a pair of 
                            encryption keys to the page, which allows user devices to decrypt transmitted information upon completing an SSL handshake. When a browser 
                            accesses a website, the web server sends a copy of the web certificate to the browser. The browser then checks if the certificate is still 
                            valid. If the certificate is approved, a new key for the session is sent back to the server, encrypted by one of the keys the server already 
                            sent. The server sends an acknowledgement back using the new key and establishes a session.

                            Indicators that a page on a website is secure include the aforementioned HTTPS in the URL, a lock symbol on the left side of the address 
                            bar on a browser, and the lack of a warning. When a web page is insecure, browsers often warn the user about the risk of data theft upon 
                            entry. The address bar will also have a symbol other than a lock to indicate that the site does not have an SSL certificate. Finally, 
                            the URL will have HTTP in it instead of HTTPS.

                            <b>SSL certificate authorities (CAs)</b> are organizations that issue SSL certificates. CAs are responsible for ensuring that websites have authentic 
                            and up-to-date SSL certificates and provide lists that browsers use to check whether or not a site can be trusted. To obtain an SSL certificate,
                            applicants need to submit a certificate signing request to a CA to receive one. The request contains information about the site and its creator 
                            alongside a public key. Should this request be verified, the CA returns an SSL certificate and a private key to the applicant.
