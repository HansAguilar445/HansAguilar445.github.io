                    <h2>The Fundamentals of Xenoblade Chronicles X’s Ground Combat</h2>
                    <div id="introduction">
                        
                        <p>
                            <b>Xenoblade Chronicles X (XCX)</b> is a real-time RPG with many complex parts to its gameplay. Set on the fictional planet of Mira, 
                            you play as a survivor of a spaceship’s crash fighting against aliens who want to wipe out humanity. In the game, you have a 
                            broad range of options for how you want to play, divided by your choice of weapons, class, and gear. You will need a <b>Nintendo 
                            Wii U</b> and the included GamePad to play the game, though you can use a Wii U Pro Controller as well.

                    <h3>Attacking</h3>
                    <div id="attack">
                        
                        <p>
                            The basics of the combat system revolve around two types of attacks: auto-attacks and Arts. When you are locked onto an enemy and in 
                            range, you will perform auto-attacks with the weapon you are using at the time with short breaks in between. These auto-attacks are 
                            weak, so do not rely on them for damage. When you want to do higher amounts of damage, you use Arts. Arts are special skills that 
                            serve different roles depending on the colour of their icon. The following list describes the types of Arts available: 
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>Melee: close-ranged attacks, indicated by an orange icon.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Ranged: long-ranged attacks, indicated by a yellow icon.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Debuff: enemy-weakening skills, indicated by a purple icon.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Buff: instant support skills, indicated by a green icon.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Aura: long-lasting support skills, indicated by a blue icon.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            You can find these Arts at the bottom of the screen and can select which one you want to use by pressing Left or Right on the D-Pad. If you 
                            want to use an Art, press the A button over the one you want when it is available.
                        </p>

                            When fighting enemies, you have two weapons that you can attack with. One of them is a melee weapon and the other is a ranged weapon. 
                            In a battle, you can only use one at a time, but you can swap your weapon with the X button or by using an Art. The following table 
                            describes your options:

                            Each weapon comes with unique Arts and, Multigun aside, are locked behind their default classes until you reach their 
                            maximum level on their best class. For example, you cannot use Dual Guns as a Galactic Knight unless you have reached 
                            Rank 10 as a Full Metal Jaguar. The Multigun is an exception because it has no specific class that uses it.

                        <p>
                            In XCX, your character has many different playstyles defined by their class. Each class has several differences that change 
                            how you play them, like different stat increases and skill options. There are four tiers of classes, with the second and third 
                            tiers diverging into different branches. To advance in a branch, you need to raise your Class Rank to Rank 10 by defeating 
                            enemies or completing side quests. Each class comes with their own unique Arts and skills, with a certain amount of slots to 
                            use them depending on which class is active at the time. Once you have achieved Rank 10 in a fourth-tier class, you can use their 
                            weapons regardless of if you remain in that class or not.

                            As you advance in your class, you obtain skills at specific ranks. These skills provide improvements to you in many different ways, 
                            from stat improvements to conditional buffs to yourself. You can improve them up to five times to boost their effects. You can only 
                            use as many as you have slots, so you must be careful when choosing which ones you intend to use.

                            <b>Tension Points (TP)</b> are to XCX what mana is to most magic-based games. TP is a currency of sorts that you use to perform the 
                            following actions:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>Use Arts that are labeled TP Arts. They use up 1000 TP.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Revive fallen party members. This uses up 3000 TP.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Activate or replenish Overdrive. This also uses up 3000 TP.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            To build up TP, there are many different methods you can use. The first method is by auto-attacking. One Assault Rifle that you get in 
                            a side quest called the Ramjet Rifle is good for this. Another method is by using Arts that give you TP under certain conditions, such 
                            as Primer or Tornado Blade. By default, your TP caps out at 3000 TP, but you can improve this by using special gear or augments to raise the cap.
                        </p>

                            After Chapter 5 of the main story, you unlock the Overdrive mechanic. In a fight, you can activate it by pressing A on the button in the centre of your 
                            Arts bar when you have 3000 TP. Once you do that, it is active for fifteen seconds by default, which you can extend with the following methods:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>Using the Hellhound skill, which extends the starting duration by up to 10 seconds.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Using Extend Overdrive augments on your armour, which increases the starting duration by up to 25 seconds each.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Using auras and buffs during Overdrive.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Pressing the Overdrive activation button on the Arts bar with 3000 TP before Overdrive ends.</p></li>

                            During this time, all of your Arts recharge quicker than they would normally and a counter appears in the middle of your screen. This counter 
                            increases with every damaging Art you use based on how many hits land, capping out at 100 hits. As you raise the counter, your damage and Arts 
                            recharge speed increase. Additionally, using specific types of Arts in conjunction with each other gives different effects. See the following 
                            list for the combos and their effects:
                        </p>
