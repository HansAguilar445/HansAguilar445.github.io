                    <p>
                        My name is Hans Aguilar. I am 16 years old, born on the 4th of April in 2005.
                        I have been studying programming for three years, web development for two years,
                        and networking for two years. I have lived in Canada for four years. While I have
                        experience in networking, my skills in software and web development are more refined.
                        I focus on software development and web development because I find those more interesting
                        and I find cybersecurity to be too big a challenge. The possibilities are nearly endless when
                        programming, with all kinds of options for tools for the job, but you do not need to remember
                        everything, just the basics. The same goes for HTML and CSS. Cybersecurity, on the other hand,
                        is more focused and requires more memorization. As my memory is lackluster, software development
                        fits my purposes
                        for that reason.

                    <p>
                        Throughout my time as a student, I have developed many skills that would be useful for
                        programming and
                        web development. The following list describes the aforementioned skills.

                                <b>C#:</b> I have used C# in software development for three years, mostly in the Unity
                                game engine.
                            </p>

                                <b>Unity Engine:</b> I have developed games in Unity for three years. Most of these
                                games have been
                                two-dimensional, though some were three-dimensional.

                                <b>HTML and CSS:</b> I have designed websites for two years using HTML and CSS. My
                                prefered
                                method of styling sites is by using Sass-based CSS.
