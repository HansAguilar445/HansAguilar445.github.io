                        My name is Hans Aguilar. I am 16 years old, born on the 4th of April in 2005. My 
                        hobbies are gaming, writing, and making props. My favourite genre of games are 
                        visual novels and roleplaying games, especially ones that reference myths and 
                        legends from all around the world. I also enjoy writing narratives. The props 
                        I make are often weapons, but I also make masks from time to time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are many things I enjoy about technology, from communication to access to 
                        practically unlimited virtual resources for learning and entertainment, but I 
                        enjoy the gaming experience most of all. YouTube and DVDs have shown me many 
                        things, entertaining and educational alike. Many games have done the same, 
                        and the Internet is a powerful resource to utilize in the search for more things to keep me occupied.

                        I was born in the Philippines, but I grew up in New Zealand. I barely spent a year in the 
                        Philippines before moving and I spent eleven years of my life in New Zealand. I came to 
                        Canada in June of 2017 and have lived here since. The city I grew up in was Auckland, on
                        the North Island of New Zealand.

                        I joined the software development course because I find it more interesting and I find 
                        cybersecurity too big a challenge. The possibilities are nearly endless when programming,
                        with all kinds of options for tools for the job, but you do not need to remember everything, 
                        just the basics. Cybersecurity, on the other hand, is more focused and seems to require more 
                        memorization. As I have terrible memory, software development fits my purposes for that reason.

                    <p>
                        Throughout my time as a student, I have developed many skills that would be useful for
                        programming and
                        web development. The following list describes the aforementioned skills.

                                <b>C#:</b> I have used C# in software development for three years, mostly in the Unity
                                game engine.

                                games have been
                                two-dimensional, though some were three-dimensional.

                                <b>HTML and CSS:</b> I have designed websites for two years using HTML and CSS. My
                                prefered
                                method of styling sites is by using Sass-based CSS.
